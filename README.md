# Custom Fog shaders for Garry's Mod
This repository contains the source code for the shaders, the entities and the wiki docs.

# Contributions welcome!
I'll accept any contributions that would make the addon better, especially visual and performance improvements on the shader sides, as I am not very proficient in HLSL.

# Wiki
Deployed wiki is available at:
